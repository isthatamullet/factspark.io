	•	3.8. Frontend Styling Setup (Tailwind CSS & Dark Mode Guide) This section provides a checklist for setting up Tailwind CSS and its dark mode functionality correctly. This should be followed during Phase 0/1 of development when setting up the frontend.
	•	I. Core Tailwind CSS Installation & Configuration:
	1.	Install Dependencies:
	•	npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer (or yarn equivalent)
	2.	Initialize Tailwind CSS:
	•	npx tailwindcss init -p (This creates tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js)
	3.	Configure tailwind.config.js:
	•	content: Ensure this array correctly points to all template files where Tailwind classes will be used.
	•	Example for Vue.js: content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}"]
	•	darkMode: Set the strategy. 'class' is highly recommended for manual control.
	•	Example: darkMode: 'class',
	4.	Create Main CSS File:
	•	Create a main CSS file (e.g., src/input.css, src/assets/main.css, or src/index.css).
	•	Add the Tailwind directives to this file:CSS  @tailwind base;
	•	@tailwind components;
	•	@tailwind utilities;
	•	   
	5.	Import Main CSS File:
	•	Ensure this main CSS file is imported into the project's entry point (e.g., main.js or App.vuefor Vue.js).
	6.	Build Process:
	•	Ensure Tailwind CSS is being processed. The development server (e.g., Vite for Vue.js) usually handles this automatically if configured correctly. If not, a script in package.json like tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch might be needed. (Vite handles this internally if PostCSS is configured).
	•	II. Dark Mode Implementation (using darkMode: 'class' strategy):
	1.	JavaScript to Toggle dark Class:
	•	Create a script (e.g., in the main JavaScript file, a utility file, or a root Vue component's <script setup>) to:
	•	Check localStorage for a saved theme preference.
	•	Check OS preference (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches).
	•	Apply the 'dark' class to the <html> element (or <body>) based on the determined preference.
	•	Create a function to toggle the 'dark' class on the <html> element and save the new preference to localStorage.
	2.	Theme Toggle Button (UI):
	•	Create a button in the UI that calls the toggle function from step II.1.
	3.	Apply Dark Mode Utility Classes:
	•	Use Tailwind's dark: variants in HTML/components.
	•	Example: <div class="bg-white text-black dark:bg-gray-900 dark:text-white">Content</div>

AI implementation guidelines:
Here's my advice for creating reliable, unbiased fact-checking:

## **Core AI Analysis Methodology**

### **1. Multi-Layer Verification Architecture**

**Primary Verification Pipeline:**
```
URL → Content Extraction → Claim Extraction → Source Retrieval → 
Cross-Verification → Confidence Scoring → Human-Readable Summary
```

**Secondary Validation Layer:**
- Cross-reference claims against multiple source types
- Validate temporal context (when was this claim first made?)
- Check for source consensus vs. outlier information
- Identify potential bias in both the original content and verification sources

### **2. Source Curation Strategy for Bias Mitigation**

**Tier 1 Sources (Highest Weight)**
- Academic institutions and peer-reviewed journals
- Government statistical agencies (Bureau of Labor Statistics, CDC, etc.)
- Established fact-checking organizations (Snopes, PolitiFact, AP Fact Check)
- Primary documents and official statements

**Tier 2 Sources (Moderate Weight)**
- Mainstream news organizations with editorial standards
- Industry trade publications
- Non-profit research organizations
- International organizations (WHO, UN, World Bank)

**Tier 3 Sources (Lower Weight, Context Only)**
- Opinion pieces clearly labeled as such
- Social media from verified accounts
- Press releases (when appropriately attributed)

**Source Diversity Requirements:**
- Include sources across political spectrum when relevant
- Prioritize original reporting over aggregation
- Weight recent sources higher for time-sensitive claims
- Flag when consensus is unavailable

## **Backend Implementation Strategy**

### **Claim Extraction Prompting**
```python
CLAIM_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
Analyze this article and extract ONLY specific, verifiable factual claims. 

EXTRACT:
✓ Statistical claims with numbers, dates, percentages
✓ Statements about events that occurred
✓ Claims about cause-and-effect relationships
✓ Attributions of quotes or actions to specific people/organizations

DO NOT EXTRACT:
✗ Opinions, predictions, or subjective statements
✗ Generally known facts (e.g., "Paris is in France")
✗ Rhetorical questions or hypotheticals

For each claim, provide:
1. Exact quote from article
2. Claim type (statistical, event, attribution, causal)
3. Temporal context (when did this supposedly happen?)
4. Specificity level (highly specific vs general)

Article: {article_text}

Format as JSON array with this structure:
[{"claim": "exact quote", "type": "statistical", "temporal_context": "2024", "specificity": "high"}]
"""
```

### **Verification Prompting Strategy**
```python
VERIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are a fact-checking analyst. Verify this claim against the provided sources.

CLAIM TO VERIFY: {claim}
TEMPORAL CONTEXT: {temporal_context}

SOURCES PROVIDED:
{sources}

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
1. SOURCE EVALUATION:
   - Are these sources authoritative for this topic?
   - How recent are they relative to the claim?
   - Do they directly address this specific claim?

2. CLAIM VERIFICATION:
   - Is the claim supported, contradicted, or not addressed?
   - Are there important nuances or context missing?
   - Is the claim partially true but misleading?

3. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
   - How certain can we be based on available evidence?
   - What additional sources would strengthen this verification?

RESPOND WITH:
- Rating: VERIFIED, PARTIALLY_VERIFIED, CONTRADICTED, INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
- Confidence: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- Explanation: [2-3 sentences explaining your reasoning]
- Key_sources: [list most relevant sources used]
- Caveats: [any important limitations or context]

Be conservative - if evidence is insufficient, say so clearly.
"""
```

## **Order of Operations (Optimized Pipeline)**

### **Phase 1: Content Processing (30-45 seconds)**
1. **URL Validation & Scraping**
   - Check robots.txt compliance
   - Extract main article content using newspaper3k or similar
   - Identify publication date and source metadata
   - Extract any embedded media or data visualizations

2. **Content Preprocessing**
   - Clean HTML artifacts and ads
   - Identify article structure (headline, subheads, body)
   - Extract author, publication info
   - Estimate article reading level and tone

### **Phase 2: Claim Analysis (45-60 seconds)**
3. **Initial Claim Extraction**
   - Use Gemini for structured claim identification
   - Categorize claims by type and verifiability
   - Identify temporal dependencies
   - Flag claims requiring specialized expertise

4. **Claim Prioritization**
   - Score claims by importance to article's main thesis
   - Identify claims most likely to be misinformation
   - Prioritize fact-checkable claims over opinions
   - Flag claims with high social/political impact

### **Phase 3: Source Retrieval (30-45 seconds)**
5. **Intelligent Source Querying**
   - Use Vertex AI Search with temporal filtering
   - Query multiple variations of each claim
   - Include synonyms and related terms
   - Apply your tiered time-window approach

6. **Source Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluate source authority and bias
   - Check publication dates against claim temporal context
   - Identify primary vs secondary sources
   - Flag potential source conflicts of interest

### **Phase 4: Verification & Synthesis (60-90 seconds)**
7. **Cross-Reference Verification**
   - Compare each claim against retrieved sources
   - Look for consensus vs outlier information
   - Identify contradictions between sources
   - Flag claims where expert consensus is evolving

8. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Weight by source quality and recency
   - Factor in claim specificity and complexity
   - Account for source consensus level
   - Adjust for your system's known limitations

## **Advanced Bias Mitigation Techniques**

### **Source Balancing Algorithm**
```python
def balance_sources(sources, claim_topic):
    """Ensure diverse perspectives while maintaining quality"""
    
    # Group by bias rating and authority level
    by_bias = group_sources_by_political_lean(sources)
    by_authority = group_sources_by_reliability(sources)
    
    # Prioritize high-authority sources across bias spectrum
    balanced_sources = []
    for bias_category in ['left', 'center', 'right']:
        high_authority = by_authority['high'] & by_bias[bias_category]
        balanced_sources.extend(high_authority[:3])  # Max 3 per bias category
    
    # Always include fact-checking organizations
    fact_checkers = filter_fact_checking_orgs(sources)
    balanced_sources.extend(fact_checkers[:2])
    
    return balanced_sources
```

### **Uncertainty Communication**
- **High Confidence**: "Multiple reliable sources confirm..."
- **Medium Confidence**: "Available evidence suggests... but additional verification needed"
- **Low Confidence**: "Insufficient reliable sources to verify this claim"
- **Conflicting Evidence**: "Sources disagree on this claim..."

## **Backend Architecture Recommendations**

### **Asynchronous Processing Pipeline**
```python
# Use Celery or similar for async processing
@celery.task
def process_article_analysis(url, article_id):
    try:
        # Phase 1: Extract and preprocess
        content = extract_article_content(url)
        
        # Phase 2: Extract claims
        claims = extract_claims_batch(content)
        
        # Phase 3: Parallel source retrieval
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
            source_futures = {
                executor.submit(retrieve_sources, claim): claim 
                for claim in claims
            }
            
            # Phase 4: Verify as sources come in

### **Quality Control Mechanisms**

1. **Confidence Thresholds**
   - Don't publish claims with confidence < 60%
   - Flag controversial topics for manual review
   - Implement cooling-off period for highly disputed claims

2. **Source Freshness Validation**
   - Automatically recheck sources older than 30 days
   - Update verification when new authoritative sources emerge
   - Flag when source consensus changes over time

3. **Bias Detection**
   - Monitor for consistent bias patterns in your source selection
   - Track verification accuracy against later authoritative sources
   - Implement feedback loops for system improvement

## **Key Implementation Recommendations**

1. **Start Conservative**: Better to say "insufficient evidence" than make incorrect claims
2. **Transparency First**: Always show your reasoning and source selection
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Track which verifications prove accurate over time
4. **Human Oversight**: Build in review processes for high-impact claims
5. **Temporal Sensitivity**: Your time-windowing approach is excellent - maintain it
6. **Source Diversity**: Actively work to include ideologically diverse but reliable sources

The key to trustworthy AI fact-checking is admitting uncertainty when it exists and being transparent about your methodology. Your hybrid RAG approach with temporal awareness is already a strong foundation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
